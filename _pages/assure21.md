In 2021, <a href="https://multiverse.ssl.berkeley.edu/ASSURE">ASSURE</a>, an REU (Research Opportunities for Undergraduates) hosted by SSL, was selected for funding and accepted its first cohort since 2017. The cohort was chosen to prioritize first-generation, community college, and otherwise underrepresented students. For ten weeks, we had ten students pair up with a research scientist at SSL or Stanford (through COFFIES). Although COVID restricted much of the in-person aspect, an on-campus poster session was held on the outdoor patio of the building. Students were also able to attend AGU#21 in New Orleans, LA.

<br>
In February 2022, ASSURE was selected to run again in the following Summer. This cohort presented at Winter AGU in Chicago. Currently we are preparing for ASSURE 2023's cohort.   
<br>
<br>
In determining the REUs programming, I encouraged the use of programming tutorials, support for developing research paper comprehension skills, and other skills I found lacking in my peers and my curriculum. I also supported the REU by serving as a member on relevant panels and a "discussion starter" in some of our planned lunchtime discussions.
