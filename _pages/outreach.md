As an untraditional student and someone from a historically excluded minority in astrophysics, I take great pride and responsibility in DEIA work and sit on the AAS/SPD Education and Public Outreach committee, and assist in the facilitation of REUs. I am always happy to chat about the experiences of being an untraditional student, a transfer student from community college, and a first-generation university student. 

From my time as an undergraduate, I have committed myself to making research opportunities in the physical sciences accessible to those from all socioeconomic classes. Please use the left navigation bar to learn more about my current and past DEIA and outreach work.
