Consequences of Fields and Flows in the Interior and Exterior of the Sun or <a href="https://coffies.stanford.edu/">COFFIES</a> is a NASA-funded Heliophysics Phase I Drive Science Center (DSC) working to establish a multi-institution collaboration to develop the most reliable data-driven physical model of solar activity possible. I am a member of the Helioseismology, REU, CET, and DEIA Teams. As a member of the Helioseismology Team, I explore modeling methods of linear waves and shocks in the solar photosphere.

I encourage anyone interested in solar physics to check out the center, such as reading our newsletter
