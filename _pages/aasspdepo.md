The Solar Physics Division (SPD) of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) established an Education & Public Outreach(EPO) committee comprised of SPD members. Our aims include the support of SPD members in their involvement in EPO
efforts, as well as create solar physics careers accessible to students, as well as promoting the role of solar physics within the presentation of broader astronomy and physical sciences.
<br>
<br>
 In addition, activities and outreach prioritize the involvement and contribution of and to the communities of underrepresented minorities in the field, especially those local to an AAS/SPD meeting host city. I have been a member since October 2022, and look forward to sharing our projects and events coming in 2023 and beyond!
