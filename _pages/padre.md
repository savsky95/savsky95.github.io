<a href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AAS...23831309M/abstract" >PADRE </a> is an upcoming mission in joint with Solar Orbiter which will observe the sun in hard X-ray. Two experiments ride on the low-earth-orbit 12U Cubesat, SHARP, and XDSOX. They are to make a determination of the angular distribution of flare-accelerated electrons. Coordinated observations with Solar Orbiter/STIX allow for the opportunity to make stereoscopic X-ray observations and, for the first time, measure the electron anisotropy of individual flares confidently.

6 Quad Timepix2 detectors will be positioned on PADRE's SHARP (Solar HArd x-Ray Polimiter) experiment. They will be tiled about a beryllium scatter rod. Although Timepix3 is used for FOXSI, the timepix2 chip for PADRE has lots of overlap between the ASIC functions and has been chosen as a more appropriate chip for the detectors based on mission needs.
