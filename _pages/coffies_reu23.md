For Summer 2023, COFFIES is funded to host an REU, which will be facilitated in tandem with SSL's ASSURE REU (running consecutively since 2021). A handful of COFFIES researchers based in Stanford, Berkeley, and beyond will mentor students for a 10 wk long summer project to culminate in a presentation, usually a poster session, at the winter AGU meeting. As a graduate student, I will lead this REU from the COFFIES side and facilitate the smooth collaboration of students and researchers from different institutions as a crossover COFFIES x ASSURE REU. As this will be the first REU hosted by COFFIES, we are grateful to have the mentorship of the ASSURE REU facilitators as we begin this program.
